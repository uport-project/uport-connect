uPort Connect
=============

### Instantly Connect Users to Your dApp

uPort is a self-sovereign digital identity platform&mdash;anchored on the Ethereum blockchain. The uPort technology primarily consists of smart contracts, developer libraries, and a mobile app. uPort identities are fully owned and controlled by the creator&mdash;independent of centralized third-parties for creation, control or validation.

Using uPort Connect allows you to:

-   Handle user logins

-   Request Ethereum transaction signing

-   Keep your users logged into an app

-   Use QR code & push notification flow for desktop browsers

-   Use frictionless app linking for mobile browsers

The uport-connect library is a client-side library that allows you to interact with a user's uPort identity&mdash;through the mobile app. Over this communication channel, you can create requests for a user's data, share credentials, and generate transactions to be signed on the user's mobile app.
